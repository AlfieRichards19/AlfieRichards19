### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ¤” About me - I'm currently a student at the University of South Wales studying Computer Science.
  
- ðŸ”­ What am i doing - I'm learning the C++ programming language with the computer science course, along with proffesionalism and information management. 
  
- ðŸŒ± My skillset - I have knowledge and am skilled in a few different programming languages, such as Python, HTML and C#. I also have a fairly competent level of the Japanese language, where i'm able to understand the majority of the sentences i come across, and have studied all modern uses of japanese grammer. 
  
- ðŸ’¬ Recent projects - Recently I've been working on creating a scientific calculator in R studio using the shiny framework. I've also been creating mini projects in C++ to aid in increasing my skill with the language. 

- âš¡ Hobbies - In my free time i generally spend my time interacting with content in japanese as i am currently learning the language and the more time i spend immersing in japanese content, the faster i will gain fluency. I spend the majority of my time reading japanese novels and manga while also watching anime and other japanese tv shows.
